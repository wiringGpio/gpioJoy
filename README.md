# GPIO Joy #

GpioJoy is a no code solution to control GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson using a XBox joystick controller. Simply create one or more config.xml files where you can map the joysticks and buttons to GPIO pins or devices such as stepper motors, motors with rotary encoders, and seven segment displays

If you do want to write a some of your own code, you can also map joysticks and buttons to your own assemblies using the program's public properties to access pins and devices defined in your configuration files.
